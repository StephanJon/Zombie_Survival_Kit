\maketitle

Consider a software engineer trying to develop a zombie survival game.
The initial process of making each individual feature such as a playable map, 
moveable character, health/ hunger system, combat system, inventory system, and 
enemy AI are all very time consuming. However, if a good basic foundation that 
covers all the basic features stated existed, the developer could focus more on 
creating their unique vision for the game starting from the foundation given. 
All the aforementioned features are the works given in the open source project, Zombie Survival Kit.
Group 6 will use this foundation and rework it from the ground up to make a fully fledged, playable 
zombie survival game rather than just individual features put together in a Unity project.
